I created a interactive dashboard regarding Road Accident Analysis.

Steps involved : 
1. Extracting the data from Kaggle.
2. Transforming the data in Power Query in Power BI.
3. Loading it in the Power BI and creating dashboard using various charts and DAX queries.

DESCRIPTION : Accident Analysis & Prevention provides wide coverage of the general areas relating to accidental injury and damage, including the pre-injury and immediate post-injury phases.

TOOLS USED : Power BI
To analyze, I did data cleaning in Power Query, used Time intelligence Function/ Calendar Date Table in Power BI, Data Modelling(Relationship between multiple tables) , YTD and Y0Y Growth Calculations using DAX, KPI and Advanced Generations, Created Custom columns and measures in the reports, Import Images.

AREAS TO BE ANALYSED :
1. Primary KPI- Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and YoY growth.
2. Primary KPI- Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY growth.
3. Secondary KPI's - Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type for current Year.
